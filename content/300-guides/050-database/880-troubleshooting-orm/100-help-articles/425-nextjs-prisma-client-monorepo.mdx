## Problem

Prisma Client + Mono repo + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) = bad

```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/nextjs-monorepo-notfound/packages/service/.next/server/pages/api/file.txt'
``` 

Schema file is included, but can not be found because of bundling step.

Issue for Next.js at TODO

## Solution

Use our magic workaround: A custom Webpack plugin we created.

Afterward installing and using that, all should be good.
